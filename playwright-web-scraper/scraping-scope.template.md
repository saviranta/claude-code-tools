# Scraping Scope

<!--
Fill in the four sections below in plain language.
No CSS selectors or technical knowledge needed — the site structure analyzer
reads this and figures out the technical details for you.
-->

## What kind of page are you scraping?

<!-- Describe the type of page. What does it show? What is it for? -->

Example: A product listing page on an e-commerce site showing a single item for sale.


## What do you want to capture?

<!-- Describe the information you want, as you would explain it to a person. -->

Example: The product name, price, description, available sizes, customer rating,
and the main product images.


## What should be ignored?

<!-- Describe what to skip — navigation, ads, banners, unrelated content. -->

Example: The site header and navigation, footer links, cookie consent banners,
"you might also like" recommendations, newsletter signup prompts, and advertisements.


## How much of the page?

<!-- Choose one and delete the other, or describe in your own words. -->

Full page — capture everything except what's listed above as ignored.

Specific content only — capture just the fields I listed above, nothing else.
