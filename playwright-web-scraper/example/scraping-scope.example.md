# Scraping Scope

## What kind of page are you scraping?

A real estate listing page showing a single apartment for sale.
Each page represents one property with its details, photos, and agent info.

## What do you want to capture?

The asking price, monthly maintenance charge, apartment size in square metres,
number of rooms, floor number, year the building was built, full street address,
neighbourhood, and the main listing description text.

## What should be ignored?

The site header and top navigation, footer with links and legal text,
cookie consent banner, sidebar with agent contact form, the map widget,
"similar listings" section at the bottom, and any advertisement banners.

## How much of the page?

Specific content only — capture just the fields I listed above, nothing else.
