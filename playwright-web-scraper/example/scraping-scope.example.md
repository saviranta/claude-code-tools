# Scraping Scope

## What kind of page are you scraping?

A product page on a snowboard webshop showing a single snowboard for sale.
Each page represents one product with its specs, pricing, and availability.

## What do you want to capture?

The product name, brand, price, any sale or original price if discounted,
available sizes, flex rating, terrain type (freestyle/freeride/all-mountain),
product description, and whether the item is in stock.

## What should be ignored?

The site header and navigation, footer with links and legal text,
cookie consent banner, "customers also bought" recommendations,
social media share buttons, and any promotional banners or ads.

## How much of the page?

Specific content only — capture just the fields I listed above, nothing else.
